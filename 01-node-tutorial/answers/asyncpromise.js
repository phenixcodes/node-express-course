/** Then create an async function called writer that takes 0 arguments, 
and that writes three lines to a file named temp.txt, by calling the writeFile function 
with await. The Promise version of writeFile takes the same arguments as the one 
you used in last weekâ€™s exercise 10-fs-sync but will return a Promise 
instead of a result directly.*/
