/** This should load the fs module, and use the asynchronous function writeFile to write 3 lines to a file,
 *  ./temporary/fileB.txt. Now, be careful here! This is our first use of asynchronous functions in this class,
 *  but we are going to use them a lot! First, you need to use the "append" flag for all but the first line. 
 *  Second, each time you write a line to the file, you need to have a callback, because the writeFile operation
 *  is asynchronous. Third, for each line you write, you need to do the write for the line that follows it 
 *  within the callback - otherwise the operations wonâ€™t happen in order. 
 *  Put console.log statements at various points in your code to tell you when each step completes. 
 *  Then run the code.  */
