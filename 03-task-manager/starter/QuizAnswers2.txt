1. In this lesson, you created a middleware function called asyncWrapper. Why?

We want to wrap our asynchronous code in an asyncWrapper to eliminate redundancies in our code.

2. Suppose that you want to make sure that both a status code and an error message 
are sent back to the user when they request the URL for a task that does not exist. 
Assume that you’ve created a CustomAPIError class and an error handler that references that class. 

Complete the code:

const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {  
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;  
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });  
  if (!task) {  
    return next(CustomAPIError(`No URL with ${taskID} found`, 404))
  }  
  res.status(200).json({ task });  
});
